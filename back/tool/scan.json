MISSION TO BE CONDUCTED.Elections are a vital part of democratic processes including political transitions, implementation of peace agreements and consolidation of democracy.Depending on the specific circumstances, a range of consequences may result from an insufficient level of security provided during an election, e.g., an inadequate level of security may discourage or inhibit participation.Conversely,  a  potential  overabundance  of  security  may  have  an  adverse  impact  and  threaten  the  integrity  of  the  electoral  process.  A robust security presence could limit overall incidences of violence. However, such a situation may influence aspects such as campaigning or voter turnout by heightening the risk of intimidation.The electoral process can be divided into three phases: pre-electoral, electoral and post-electoral. Activities during each phase may include security; training of neutral country security forces; ensuring freedom of movement; engineering and communication infrastructure support; transport of supplies.The pre-electoral phase starts with the actual preparations for holding elections and lasts until the end of the electoral campaign. The electoral phase is the actual day (or days) dedicated to the casting of votes by eligible voters and ends with the closure of polling stations. In most countries campaigning is prohibited during the voting period.The post-electoral phase is the period between the closing of polling stations and the announcement of the final results. It includes, for example, the sealing and safe transport of ballot boxes, the counting of ballot papers, independent oversight over the counting process, the collation of results, the declaration of provisional results, the resolution of electoral disputes and challenges of results, and the declaration of  the  final  results.  In  some  circumstances  this  phase  may  continue  through  to  the  appropriate implementation of the election results.The boundaries between the different electoral phases are often not clearly demarcated and may overlap. Some activities may start during one phase and continue during another. For example, certain categories  of  persons  may  be  eligible  to  cast  their  votes  before  the  day  of  voting  (special  votes), including patients in hospitals, the infirm and elderly, members of the security forces who will provide security during voting, emergency personnel or those who will be absent from their constituency on the day of elections.Some issues that Coalition forces must maintain awareness of regarding the role of the security during elections are:Whether security during voter registration and throughout the election process is provided in a non-partisan and non-discriminatory manner. Whether the presence of security forces could be considered intimidating at any stage, for example on the day of voting.The manner in which election rallies of the incumbent party and opposition parties are policed, the security provided to candidates and participants at the rallies, and measures taken to ensure law and order (including the use of force).Measures taken to ensure security during the voting process, including the security of the polling stations, voters and election materials, and how the security forces react to situations that threaten the security of voters or the voting process.Measures adopted to prevent violence during the counting of votes and immediately following the announcement of results and whether the actions by the security forces are in accordance with international law (for example, the use of force and firearms).As of XXXXXXZ APR, conduct referendum security presence, engineering, transport, and observer team support operations vicinity Cotentin polling stations IOT: Ensure safe, reliable, and monitored operation of Cotentin polling stations in support of fair and free elections.3. EXECUTIONConcept of OPS:  7 days before the election period, United Nations police move into the vicinity of the polling sites and provide security. Simultaneously, Confederation Forces locate vicinity of the polling sites and provide engineering, transport, and observer teams in support of and at the request of polling authorities. The goal of both United Nations police and Confederation Forces is to create a permissive environment to maximize participation by eligible voters. Prior to the start of voting, observer teams will be fully operational at each polling station to monitor all voting activities. Upon completion of the voting period, United Nations police will continue to provide security in conjunction with Confederation Forces providing electrical, secure communications, and transport support at the request of polling authorities to allow for accurate ballot count and announcement of results.  Tasks:United Nation police conducts security operations in the vicinity of the polling sites starting 1 week before the election period and ending after the voting tallying to ensure a permissive environment that encourages the maximum unhindered voting of all eligible citizens followed by accurate counting and result reporting. 1 Engineer Battalion conducts engineering support actions to ensure ready accessible polling sites with discrete/private polling and necessary electrical functionality throughout the voting, tallying, and results announcement period in support of local authorities.1 Communications Battalion be prepared to provide communications (internet or other) connectivity support for polling stations in support of local authorities throughout the voting, tallying, and results announcement period.1 Rotary Wing Transport Squadron be prepared to rapidly transport voting station supplies by helicopter to each Cotentin polling station such as ballots, ballot boxes, collapsible ballot privacy booths.

Activities during each phase may include security; training of neutral country security forces; ensuring freedom of movement; engineering and communication infrastructure support; transport of supplies.The pre-electoral phase starts with the actual preparations for holding elections and lasts until the end of the electoral campaign. The electoral phase is the actual day (or days) dedicated to the casting of votes by eligible voters and ends with the closure of polling stations. In most countries campaigning is prohibited during the voting period.The post-electoral phase is the period between the closing of polling stations and the announcement of the final results. It includes, for example, the sealing and safe transport of ballot boxes, the counting of ballot papers, independent oversight over the counting process, the collation of results, the declaration of provisional results, the resolution of electoral disputes and challenges of results, and the declaration of  the  final  results.  In  some  circumstances  this  phase  may  continue  through  to  the  appropriate implementation of the election results.The boundaries between the different electoral phases are often not clearly demarcated and may overlap. Some activities may start during one phase and continue during another. For example, certain categories  of  persons  may  be  eligible  to  cast  their  votes  before  the  day  of  voting  (special  votes), including patients in hospitals, the infirm and elderly, members of the security forces who will provide security during voting, emergency personnel or those who will be absent from their constituency on the day of elections.Some issues that Coalition forces must maintain awareness of regarding the role of the security during elections are:Whether security during voter registration and throughout the election process is provided in a non-partisan and non-discriminatory manner. Whether the presence of security forces could be considered intimidating at any stage, for example on the day of voting.The manner in which election rallies of the incumbent party and opposition parties are policed, the security provided to candidates and participants at the rallies, and measures taken to ensure law and order (including the use of force).Measures taken to ensure security during the voting process, including the security of the polling stations, voters and election materials, and how the security forces react to situations that threaten the security of voters or the voting process.Measures adopted to prevent violence during the counting of votes and immediately following the announcement of results and whether the actions by the security forces are in accordance with international law (for example, the use of force and firearms).As of XXXXXXZ APR, conduct referendum security presence, engineering, transport, and observer team support operations vicinity Cotentin polling stations IOT: Ensure safe, reliable, and monitored operation of Cotentin polling stations in support of fair and free elections.3.

Activities during each phase may include security; training of neutral country security forces; ensuring freedom of movement; engineering and communication infrastructure support; transport of supplies.The pre-electoral phase starts with the actual preparations for holding elections and lasts until the end of the electoral campaign. The electoral phase is the actual day (or days) dedicated to the casting of votes by eligible voters and ends with the closure of polling stations. In most countries campaigning is prohibited during the voting period.The post-electoral phase is the period between the closing of polling stations and the announcement of the final results. It includes, for example, the sealing and safe transport of ballot boxes, the counting of ballot papers, independent oversight over the counting process, the collation of results, the declaration of provisional results, the resolution of electoral disputes and challenges of results, and the declaration of  the  final  results.  In  some  circumstances  this  phase  may  continue  through  to  the  appropriate implementation of the election results.The boundaries between the different electoral phases are often not clearly demarcated and may overlap. Some activities may start during one phase and continue during another. For example, certain categories  of  persons  may  be  eligible  to  cast  their  votes  before  the  day  of  voting  (special  votes), including patients in hospitals, the infirm and elderly, members of the security forces who will provide security during voting, emergency personnel or those who will be absent from their constituency on the day of elections.Some issues that Coalition forces must maintain awareness of regarding the role of the security during elections are:Whether security during voter registration and throughout the election process is provided in a non-partisan and non-discriminatory manner. Whether the presence of security forces could be considered intimidating at any stage, for example on the day of voting.The manner in which election rallies of the incumbent party and opposition parties are policed, the security provided to candidates and participants at the rallies, and measures taken to ensure law and order (including the use of force).Measures taken to ensure security during the voting process, including the security of the polling stations, voters and election materials, and how the security forces react to situations that threaten the security of voters or the voting process.Measures adopted to prevent violence during the counting of votes and immediately following the announcement of results and whether the actions by the security forces are in accordance with international law (for example, the use of force and firearms).As of XXXXXXZ APR, conduct referendum security presence, engineering, transport, and observer team support operations vicinity Cotentin polling stations IOT: Ensure safe, reliable, and monitored",

MISSION TO BE CONDUCTED.Elections are a vital part of democratic processes including political transitions, implementation of peace agreements and consolidation of democracy.Depending on the specific circumstances, a range of consequences may result from an insufficient level of security provided during an election, e.g., an inadequate level of security may discourage or inhibit participation.Conversely,  a  potential  overabundance  of  security  may  have  an  adverse  impact  and  threaten  the  integrity  of  the  electoral  process.  A robust security presence could limit overall incidences of violence. However, such a situation may influence aspects such as campaigning or voter turnout by heightening the risk of intimidation.The electoral process can be divided into three phases: pre-electoral, electoral and post-electoral. Activities during each phase may include security; training of neutral country security forces; ensuring freedom of movement; engineering and communication infrastructure support; transport of supplies.The pre-electoral phase starts with the actual preparations for holding elections and lasts until the end of the electoral campaign. The electoral phase is the actual day (or days) dedicated to the casting of votes by eligible voters and ends with the closure of polling stations. In most countries campaigning is prohibited during the voting period.The post-electoral phase is the period between the closing of polling stations and the announcement of the final results. It includes, for example, the sealing and safe transport of ballot boxes, the counting of ballot papers, independent oversight over the counting process, the collation of results, the declaration of provisional results, the resolution of electoral disputes and challenges of results, and the declaration of  the  final  results.  In  some  circumstances  this  phase  may  continue  through  to  the  appropriate implementation of the election results.The boundaries between the different electoral phases are often not clearly demarcated and may overlap. Some activities may start during one phase and continue during another. For example, certain categories  of  persons  may  be  eligible  to  cast  their  votes  before  the  day  of  voting  (special  votes), including patients in hospitals, the infirm and elderly, members of the security forces who will provide security during voting, emergency personnel or those who will be absent from their constituency on the day of elections.Some issues that Coalition forces must maintain awareness of regarding the role of the security during elections are:Whether security during voter registration and throughout the election process is provided in a non-partisan and non-discriminatory manner. Whether the presence of security forces could be considered intimidating at any stage, for example on the day of voting.The manner in which election rallies of the incumbent party and opposition parties are policed, the security provided to candidates and participants at the rallies, and measures taken to ensure law and order (including the use of force).Measures taken to ensure security during the voting process, including the security of the polling stations, voters and election materials, and how the security forces react to situations that threaten the security of voters or the voting process.Measures adopted to prevent violence during the counting of votes and immediately following the announcement of results and whether the actions by the security forces are in accordance with international law (for example, the use of force and firearms).As of XXXXXXZ APR, conduct referendum security presence, engineering, transport, and observer team support operations vicinity Cotentin polling stations IOT: Ensure safe, reliable, and monitored operation of Cotentin polling stations in support of fair and free elections.3.

OHQ believes a fair and free Cotentin referendum will not take place unless action is taken to secure the polling stations. OHQ is currently in consultation with the Coalition to determine the date that the Cotentin referendum will be held.Opposing Forces.Expect Montrena and PSF to attempt to influence the future referendum through information operations and unconventional warfare to discredit elections in Cotentin and portray a hostile environment. Potential actions may include asymmetric attacks by Montrena Special Forces or PSF against government officials and polling stations, disinformation, false media broadcasting, cyber-attacks, or other actions that would de-legitimize the fair representation of ethnic minorities on the Cotentin Peninsula.Friendly Forces.The initial composition of forces may include the below forces (additional forces may be requested as needed):United Nations PoliceGendarmerie Nationale Security BrigadeEngineer BattalionCommunications BattalionNeutral military and police forces as available2. MISSION TO BE CONDUCTED.Elections are a vital part of democratic processes including political transitions, implementation of peace agreements and consolidation of democracy.Depending on the specific circumstances, a range of consequences may result from an insufficient level of security provided during an election, e.g., an inadequate level of security may discourage or inhibit participation.Conversely,  a  potential  overabundance  of  security  may  have  an  adverse  impact  and  threaten  the  integrity  of  the  electoral  process.  A robust security presence could limit overall incidences of violence. However, such a situation may influence aspects such as campaigning or voter turnout by heightening the risk of intimidation.The electoral process can be divided into three phases: pre-electoral, electoral and post-electoral. Activities during each phase may include security; training of neutral country security forces; ensuring freedom of movement; engineering and communication infrastructure support; transport of supplies.The pre-electoral phase starts with the actual preparations for holding elections and lasts until the end of the electoral campaign. The electoral phase is the actual day (or days) dedicated to the casting of votes by eligible voters and ends with the closure of polling stations. In most countries campaigning is prohibited during the voting period.The post-electoral phase is the period between the closing of polling stations and the announcement of the final results. It includes, for example, the sealing and safe transport of ballot boxes, the counting of ballot papers, independent oversight over the counting process, the collation of results, the declaration of provisional results, the resolution of electoral disputes and challenges of results, and the declaration of  the  final  results.  In  some  circumstances  this  phase  may  continue  through  to  the  appropriate implementation of the election results.The boundaries between the different electoral phases are often not clearly demarcated and may overlap. Some activities may start during one phase and continue during another. For example, certain categories  of  persons  may  be  eligible  to  cast  their  votes  before  the  day  of  voting  (special  votes), including patients in hospitals, the infirm and elderly, members of the security forces who will provide security during voting, emergency personnel or those who will be absent from their constituency on the day of elections.Some issues that Coalition forces must maintain awareness of regarding the role of the security during elections are:Whether security during voter registration and throughout the election process is provided in a non-partisan and non-discriminatory manner. Whether the presence of security forces could be considered intimidating at any stage, for example on the day of voting.The manner in which election rallies of the incumbent party and opposition parties are policed, the security provided to candidates and participants at the rallies, and measures taken to ensure law and order (including the use of force).Measures taken to ensure security during the voting process, including the security of the polling stations, voters and election materials, and how the security forces react to situations that threaten the security of voters or the voting process.Measures adopted to prevent violence during the counting of votes and immediately following the announcement of results and whether the actions by the security forces are in accordance with international law (for example, the use of force and firearms).As of XXXXXXZ APR, conduct referendum security presence, engineering, transport, and observer team support operations vicinity Cotentin polling stations IOT: Ensure safe, reliable, and monitored operation of Cotentin polling stations in support of fair and free elections.3. EXECUTIONConcept of OPS:  7 days before the election period, United Nations police move into the vicinity of the polling sites and provide security. Simultaneously, Confederation Forces locate vicinity of the polling sites and provide engineering, transport, and observer teams in support of and at the request of polling authorities. The goal of both United Nations police and Confederation Forces is to create a permissive environment to maximize participation by eligible voters. Prior to the start of voting, observer teams will be fully operational at each polling station to monitor all voting activities. Upon completion of the voting period, United Nations police will continue to provide security in conjunction with Confederation Forces providing electrical, secure communications, and transport support at the request of polling authorities to allow for accurate ballot count and announcement of results.  Tasks:United Nation police conducts security operations in the vicinity of the polling sites starting 1 week before the election period and ending after the voting tallying to ensure a permissive environment that encourages the maximum unhindered voting of all eligible citizens followed by accurate counting and result reporting. 1 Engineer Battalion conducts engineering support actions to ensure ready accessible polling sites with discrete/private polling and necessary electrical functionality throughout the voting, tallying, and results announcement period in support of local authorities.1 Communications Battalion be prepared to provide communications (internet or other) connectivity support for polling stations in support of local authorities throughout the voting, tallying, and results announcement period.1 Rotary Wing Transport Squadron be prepared to rapidly transport voting station supplies by helicopter to each Cotentin polling station such as ballots, ballot boxes, collapsible ballot privacy booths. Transport helicopters will be employed and not attack helicopters to ensure neutral appearance.POLAD coordinates with each Confederation country for government representatives to form observer teams consisting of a participant from each country located at each Cotentin polling site to monitor all voting activities.POLAD to develop quantitative and qualitative metrics to determine success indicators aligned with free and fair elections.PUBLIC AFFAIRS to develop positive multi media campaign and media tours prior to, during, and after the referendum.End State: Polling sites functional and protected against outside intervention.

LCC will be in charge of their own defense from air threat below 5000 AGL, as a final fence.AMPHIB TG duty is both to disembark ground forces and to assume air defense within 25 Nm of Cherbourg harbor, from SFC to UNLACC is to assume air defense in the Cotentin peninsula (limited by the line BAYEUX AVRANCHES) and IVO the island to be seized (GUERNEZEY and ADERNEY), except in a 25 Nm bubble around CHERBOURG during the amphibious operation. A surge between H - 2 and H+12, will concentrate the ACC efforts. As detailed in the CONOPS, Montrena national airspace must not be violated. From H-2 a QRA must be ready for SEAD in case of unsuccessful SEAD by SOCC. Furthermore a QRA is able to provide CAS on request.

MISSION.AJF deploys forces into South Sequena IOT assist Sequenian forces in the defense of Sequena to prevent further Confederation advances.3. EXECUTIONConcept of OPSThe priority for the AJF is to position forces to assist the Sequenian forces in stopping the Confederation advance.LCC will support Sequenian forces to fix the CONFEDERATION offensive.  They will accomplish this by deploying Alliance ground forces into Sequena to stop the CONFEDERATION offensive by securing the GRANVILLE area.  In addition, they will BPT conduct a counter-attack in direction of CAEN or ROUEN.MCC will engage CONFEDERATION naval vessels in the Cimbrian Channel which are involved in supporting amphibious operations into Sequena.  Additionally, they will prepare themselves to engage Oliveland vessels involved in the landings by marking them and reporting their direct involvement in landing forces in Sequena.  On order from the COMANFOR, naval vessels will engage Oliveland navy vessels. The AEJF will remain off the coast and will not disembark.
